            <h3>For this lesson, you'll need the following:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
                <li>PASW (formerly SPSS) statistics software, or free trial download</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>You should already be familiar with:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The basic functions and tools of Excel</li>
                <li>Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics</li>
                <li>Research design and how to identify independent variables and dependent</li>
            </ul>
        </aside>

        <h3>This short lesson is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students undertaking
            original research projects. After completing the 30-minute lesson, you will be able to to:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient analysis</li>
            <li> Run basic descriptive statistics in Excel</li>
            <li> Prepare the document for statistical analysis in the software package PASW</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Format data for analysis</h2>
        <p>Make sure the computer you are working on has Microsoft Excel installed. Open the document
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JV8LwS9NL0">ToolBox_DataLesson.xls</a> in
            Excel and follow along with the lesson, taking action as instructed.
            In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been entered in the first row of
            each column.
        </p>


        <ol>
            <li>Each variable name must be different from other variable names.</li>
            <li>The first variable (in column A) is a unique identifier.</li>
            <li>Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters), so change
                <em>tutorial_types to tutorial_types.</em></li>
            <li>Name variables so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore, change <em>use</em> and <em>useful to
                perc_ease_of_use and perc_usefulness,</em> respectively.</li>
            <li>Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 1, and it should now be readily apparent that
                Column F refers to <em>Perceived Usefulness</em> and Column G refers to <em>Perceived Ease of
                Use.</em></li>
        </ol>
        <figure>


            <img src="Images/datalesson_fig3.png"
                alt="Figure 1: The Raw_Dataset spreadsheet with variable names changed to be more intuitive.">

            <figcaption>Tutorial type, gender, experience, and task categorical values have been formatted
                as dichotomous variables.</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>Data values, or rows, have been input for each subject in the experiment.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Decide on input conventions and stick to them. In <em>gender</em>, change the "female" value to
                "F".</li>
            <li>Separate data into component values whenever possible by adding new columns. For
                example, tasks_completed values (Y/Y/N) can be broken up into three components. So,
                add columns <em>task1, task2,</em> and <em>task3,</em> and reformat values appropriately.</li>
            <li>Double-check to ensure no data entry errors have been made, then delete the old
                tasks_completed column.</li>
            <li>Your Raw_Dataset spreadsheet should now look like Figure 2.</li>
        </ol>

        <figure>
            <img src="Images/datalesson_fig2.png"
                alt="Figure 2: The Raw_Dataset spreadsheet with data values entered for each subject.">
            <figcaption>Values for each variable are entered in a consistent format.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Replace categorical data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) to indicate whether or not the
            value is represented for the given subject/item. This makes the categorical values
            dichotomous, which gives the researcher maximum flexibility in testing for relationships or
            correlations.</p>

        <aside class="sidebar">
            <h3>Formatting data for analysis</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Dichotomous variables allow for the easy isolation of characteristics for analysis.
                For example, separating experience levels allows the researcher to test in PASW
                whether subjects with low experience have <em>perceived</em> ease of use scores
                significantly different from those with medium and high experience levels.</strong>
            </p>
        </aside>

        <ol>
            <li>Copy the Raw_Dataset values into the Sheet2 tab. Rename this sheet Formatted_Data.</li>
            <li>In the Formatted_Data sheet, add new columns with <strong>Insert > Columns</strong> for each distinct
                value in categorical data columns (tutorial_types, gender, exp_level, task1, task2, and
                task3). You do not have to add a new column for task1, task2, and task3 because their
                values are already dichotomous.
            </li>
            <li>Rename columns according to each possible categorical value. Copy and paste the
                values from the original column.</li>
            <li>Replace dichotomous data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) using the replace
                function: <strong>Edit > Replace.</strong></li>
            <li>Your Formatted_Data spreadsheet should now look like Figure 3.</li>
        </ol>

            <figcaption>Tutorial type, experience, and task categorical values have been formatted
                as dichotomous variables.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Run descriptive statistics</h3>

        <aside class="sidebar">
            <p> Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example,
                perc_enjoy is much higher on average than perc_usefulness, which also has a large
                variance. This suggests that a segment of users may not have considered the
                system useful even though they enjoyed using it.</p>
        </aside>

      <h2>Run descriptive statistics</h2>
      <p> Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet. If
            necessary, rearrange columns so that data requiring summary, those with continuous values,
            are adjacent. (In the spreadsheet, the continuous values of <em>perc_enjoy, perc_usefulness, and
            perc_ease_of_use</em> are already adjacent.) Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data
            requiring
            summary, making sure not to
            include variable labels.</p>
        Add-Ins... and make sure Analysis ToolPak is checked. Click OK.
        2. Go to Tools > Data Analysis and select Descriptive Statistics. Click OK.
        3. Enter the input range in the blank and check Summary Statistics. Click OK. -->
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <strong>Tools > Add-Ins...</strong> and make sure <strong>Analysis ToolPak</strong> is checked. Click OK.</li>
            <li>Go to <strong>Tools > Data Analysis</strong> and select <strong>Descriptive Statistics.</strong> Click OK.</li>
            <li>Enter the input range in the blank and check <strong>Summary Statistics.</strong> Click OK.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet. Rename this spreadsheet
            Descriptive_Stats. Label the output according to the variables. For example, Column 1 should
            be perc_enjoy. Your Descriptive_Stats spreadsheet should now look like Figure 4.
            Analyzing descriptive statistics is a great way to start appraising a dataset before running
            inferential statistics. What insights about the dataset can you glean from the summary statistics
            for <em>perc_usefulness and perc_ease_of_use?</em>
        </p>
        <figure>

            <img src="Images/datalesson_fig4.png"
                alt="Figure 4: The Descriptive_Stats spreadsheet with descriptive statistics for each variable.">

            <figcaption>Excel will not run descriptive statistics with non-numeric characters, so the variable
                labels must be re-entered.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Run inferential statistics</h3>
        <p>Open PASW and upload the spreadsheet. (IIT labs in Stuart Building, room 112, have PASW.
            You can also download a 30-day free trial.)</p>
        <ol>
            <li>When PASW starts, it will prompt you for a data source. Select Open an existing data
                source > More Files...
            </li>
            <li>Set the file type to Excel, then find and open the file.</li>
            <li>From the list, select the Formatted_Data worksheet. Click OK. You should now see the
                dataset.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The most commonly used statistical methods and tests are found under the Analyze menu in
            the standard toolbar. Figure 5 shows where to find some common statistical methods and tests. Under PASW's
            Analyze menu, see if you can also find the following:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test</li>
            <li>Simple linear regression</li>
            <li>Non-parametric correlation</li>
        </ol>

        <figure>

            <img src="Images/datalesson_fig5.png"
                alt="Figure 5: The PASW Analyze menu with common statistical methods and tests.">

            <figcaption>Don't assume PASW doesn't run a given test. Many are located under broader
                statistical classifications.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Use your prior knowledge or the <a href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/default.htm"><em><u>Choosing the Correct Statistic</u></em></a> resource to determine which
            statistic to run to find whether there is a significant difference in perc_usefulness between
            free_play and other tutorial types.</p>

        <aside class="sidebar">
            <p> <strong>Consult <a href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/default.htm"><u>UCLA's</u><u><em>Choosing the Correct Statistic</em></u></a> to ensure the statistical anlaysis is <br>
                appropriate for your research question(s), variables of interest, and associated data
                types.</strong></p>
        </aside>

        <p>You should have determined that the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance is the
            appropriate test. Go to <strong>Analyze > Nonparametric Tests > K Independent Samples...</strong> A new
            window will open prompting you to select the variables (by column name) to be tested.</p>


        <ol>
            <li>Select the <em>perc_usefulness</em> variable from the scrollable list on the left, and click the top
                arrow to move it to the Test Variable List (i.e. dependent variable).
            </li>
            <li>Select the <em>free_play</em> variable from the scrollable list, and click the bottom arrow to move
                it to the Grouping Variable section (i.e. independent variable).</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Define Range...</strong>, and enter "0" in the Minimum field and "1" in the Maximum field.
                This specifies the two categorical variables to be tested. Your screen should now look
                like Figure 6. Click Continue.</li>
        </ol>
        <figure>

            <img src="Images/datalesson_fig6.png"
                alt="Figure 6: The Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance window with the variables selected.">

            <figcaption>For Kruskal-Wallis, an independent (free_play) and a dependent variable
                (perc_usefulness) are selected.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Click OK to display the statistical analysis results to new viewing window. Your results screen
            should look like Figure 7. Because statistical analysis output contains many numerical
            components (some of which must be cited in formal reports), it is a good idea to save it to a
            format independent of the PASW software. To save the results, go to <strong>File > Export.</strong> Change</p>
        <p>Document Type to the desired output format (Word, Excel, PDF, etc.), then click OK.</p>
